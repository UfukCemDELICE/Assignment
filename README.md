# Assignment
There are some problems due to logic of the application. I just wanted to let know that I am aware of all. Although Axios services created, I could not implement into pages. Therefore client and server connections are made via simple fetch Api. From the CRUD process to JWT all server side of the application works properly. However; after the clicking on the delete button, user has to refresh the page in order to see new list. Although update functions works on Postman, Edit button and main page still static for client side. Also JWT is not setted for client. My aim was actually creating fully working application with well designed logic and deploy it on DigitalOcean and let you try the application as a end user, unfortunately the process did not go as I expected.
